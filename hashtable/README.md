# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
## What is the Hash table in python?
In python, the Hash table (Hash map) is a type of data structure that maps keys to its value pairs. It makes accessing data faster as the index value behaves as a key for data value.

 ***- The keys of the dictionary are hashable i.e. the are generated by hashing function which generates unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.***

- ***The order of data elements in a dictionary is not fixed***

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods

- Set : set the key and value pair in the table

- get : to Return Value associated with that key in the table

- contains : to return Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already

- keys :to  Returns  Collection of keys

- hash : to return Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O(1) for the time & space complexity except for the hash O(n) for time complexity.


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
- set(self, key, value)
- get(self, key)
- contains(self, key)
- keys(self)
- hash(self, key)
